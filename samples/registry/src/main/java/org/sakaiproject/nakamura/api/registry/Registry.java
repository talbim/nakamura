/**
 * <p>
 * An interface representing a registry. Implementations of this will probably
 * use memory management techniques and so anything intending to add items to
 * this should not assume that the registry will maintain references to their
 * objects to prevent garbage collection.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This means that you <b>must</b> keep a local reference to the element that is
 * added to the registry in you local classes to keep it from being garbage
 * collected.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If you do
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Registry r;
 * r.add(new RestProvider());
 * </pre>
 *
 * The RestProvider just created will immediately be garbage collected and be
 * removed from the registry. You should do
 *
 * <pre>
 *
 * private RestProvider restProvider;
 *
 * public init() {
 *   Registry r;
 *   restProvider = new RestProvider();
 *   r.add(restProvider);
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * And maintain a reference to the class that contains the property
 * <i>restProvider</i>.
 * </p>
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 * <p>
 * Although this class contains a add and remove, and invoking add and remove
 * will add and remove entries and notify any listeners. The class maintains
 * only weak references to the items added. If all other references are removed,
 * then the item in the registry will also be removed by and internal process.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The same goes for any listener added to the registry.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If Providers are remove by the Garbage Gollector the remove events will not
 * fire. So it is important where you know that a consumer is holding a
 * reference to explicity invoke remove, if your classloader is not be held in
 * an open state.
 * </p>
